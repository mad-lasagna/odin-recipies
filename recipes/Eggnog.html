    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Eggnog is a rich, creamy holiday beverage traditionally made with milk, cream, sugar, whipped eggs, and warm spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. Often served chilled, it can also be enjoyed warm and is sometimes spiked with spirits such as rum, bourbon, or brandy for an added festive kick. The drink has a velvety texture and a sweet, custard-like flavor, making it a classic treat during the Christmas season. Eggnog is often garnished with a sprinkle of nutmeg or cinnamon and served in mugs or glasses, evoking cozy, celebratory vibes. Non-alcoholic versions are also popular for family gatherings and holiday parties.
